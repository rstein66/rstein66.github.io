## Getting started

Want to learn more about Jekyll? Check out [this tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/).
Why Jekyll? Read [Andrej Karpathy's blog post](https://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/)!

### Installation

For a hands-on walkthrough of al-folio installation, check out [this cool video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6AJ9qPPoyc) by one of the community members! üé¨ üçø

The preferred way of using this template is by clicking in [Use this template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template) above the file list.
Then, create a new repository at `github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>`. If you plan to upload your site to `<your-github-username>.github.io`,
note that the name of your repository must be `<your-github-username>.github.io` or `<your-github-orgname>.github.io`, as stated in the [GitHub pages docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites).
For more information on how to deploy your site, check the [Deployment](#deployment) section below. After you created your new repository, just download it to your machine:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
```

---

#### Local setup using Docker (Recommended)
Using Docker to install Jekyll and Ruby dependencies is the easiest way.

You need to take the following steps to get `al-folio` up and running on your local machine:

- First, install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- Finally, run the following command that will pull the latest pre-built image from DockerHub and will run your website.

```bash
$ docker compose up
```

Note that when you run it for the first time, it will download a docker image of size 400MB or so. 

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!). After you are done, you can use the same command (`docker compose up`) to render the webpage with all you changes. Also, make sure to commit your final changes.

> To change port number, you can edit `docker-compose.yml` file.

<details><summary>(click to expand) <strong>Build your own docker image:</strong></summary>

> Note: this approach is only necessary if you would like to build an older or very custom version of al-folio.

Build and run a new docker image using:

```bash
$ docker compose up --build
```

> If you want to update jekyll, install new ruby packages, etc., all you have to do is build the image again using `--force-recreate` argument at the end of previous command! It will download ruby and jekyll and install all ruby packages again from scratch.

</details>

#### Deployment

Deploying your website to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is the most popular option.
Starting version [v0.3.5](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/releases/tag/v0.3.5), **al-folio** will automatically re-deploy your webpage each time you push new changes to your repository! :sparkles:

**For personal and organization webpages:**

- [x] The name of your repository **MUST BE** `<your-github-username>.github.io` or `<your-github-orgname>.github.io`.
- [x] In `_config.yml`, set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` and leave `baseurl` empty.
- [ ] Set up automatic deployment of your webpage (see instructions below).
- [ ] Make changes, commit, and push!
- [ ] After deployment, the webpage will become available at `<your-github-username>.github.io`.

**For project pages:**

1. In `_config.yml`, set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` and `baseurl` to `/<your-repository-name>/`.
2. Set up automatic deployment of your webpage (see instructions below).
3. Make changes, commit, and push!
4. After deployment, the webpage will become available at `<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`.

**To enable automatic deployment:**

- [x] Click on **Actions** tab and **Enable GitHub Actions**; do not worry about creating any workflows as everything has already been set for you.
- [x] Go to Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions, and give **Read and write permissions** to GitHub Actions
- [ ] Make any other changes to your webpage, commit, and push. This will automatically trigger the **Deploy** action.
- [ ] Wait for a few minutes and let the action complete. You can see the progress in the **Actions** tab. If completed successfully, in addition to the `master` branch, your repository should now have a newly built `gh-pages` branch.
- [x] Finally, in the **Settings** of your repository, in the Pages section, set the branch to `gh-pages` (**NOT** to `master`). For more details, see [Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source).

If you keep your site on another branch, open `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` **on the branch you keep your website on** and change on->push->branches and on->pull\_request->branches to the branch you keep your website on. This will trigger the action on pulls/pushes on that branch. The action will then deploy the website on the branch it was triggered from.

<details><summary>(click to expand) <strong>Manual deployment to GitHub Pages:</strong></summary>

If you need to manually re-deploy your website to GitHub pages, go to Actions, click "Deploy" in the left sidebar, then "Run workflow."

</details>

### FAQ

Here are some frequently asked questions.
If you have a different question, please ask using [Discussions](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/discussions/categories/q-a).

1. **Q:** After I create a new repository from this template and setup the repo, I get a deployment error.
   Isn't the website supposed to correctly deploy automatically? <br>
   **A:** Yes, if you are using release `v0.3.5` or later, the website will automatically and correctly re-deploy right after your first commit.
   Please make some changes (e.g., change your website info in `_config.yml`), commit, and push.
   Make sure to follow [deployment instructions](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio#deployment) in the previous section.
   (Relevant issue: [209](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/209#issuecomment-798849211).)

2. **Q:** I am using a custom domain (e.g., `foo.com`).
   My custom domain becomes blank in the repository settings after each deployment.
   How do I fix that? <br>
   **A:** You need to add `CNAME` file to the `master` or `source` branch of your repository.
   The file should contain your custom domain name.
   (Relevant issue: [130](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/130).)

3. **Q:** My webpage works locally.
    But after deploying, it fails to build and throws `Unknown tag 'toc'`.
    How do I fix that? <br>
   **A:** Make sure you followed through the [deployment instructions](#deployment) in the previous section.
   You should have set the deployment branch to `gh-pages`.
   (Related issue: [1438](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/1438).)

4. **Q:** My webpage works locally.
    But after deploying, it is not displayed correctly (CSS and JS is not loaded properly).
    How do I fix that? <br>
   **A:** Make sure to correctly specify the `url` and `baseurl` paths in `_config.yml`.
   Set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` or to `https://<your.custom.domain>` if you are using a custom domain.
   If you are deploying a personal or organization website, leave `baseurl` blank.
   If you are deploying a project page, set `baseurl: /<your-project-name>/`.
   If all previous steps were done correctly, all is missing is
   [for your browser to fetch again the site stylesheet](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/1398#issuecomment-1609518404).

5. **Q:** Atom feed doesn't work. Why?
   <br>
   **A:** Make sure to correctly specify the `url` and `baseurl` paths in `_config.yml`.
  RSS Feed plugin works with these correctly set up fields: `title`, `url`, `description` and `author`.
  Make sure to fill them in an appropriate way and try again.

6. **Q:** My site doesn't work when I enable `related_blog_posts`. Why? <br>
   **A:** This is probably due to the [classifier reborn](https://github.com/jekyll/classifier-reborn) plugin, which is used to calculate
   related posts. If the error states `Liquid Exception: Zero vectors can not be normalized...`, it means that it could not calculate related
   posts for a specific post. This is usually caused by [empty or minimal blog posts](https://github.com/jekyll/classifier-reborn/issues/64)
   without meaningful words (i.e. only [stop words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words)) or even
   [specific characters](https://github.com/jekyll/classifier-reborn/issues/194) you used in your posts. Also, the calculus for similar posts are
   made for every `post`, which means every page that uses `layout: post`, including the announcements. To change this behavior, simply add
   `related_posts: false` to the front matter of the page you don't want to display related posts on.

## Features

### Publications

Your publications' page is generated automatically from your BibTex bibliography.
Simply edit `_bibliography/papers.bib`.
You can also add new `*.bib` files and customize the look of your publications however you like by editing `_pages/publications.md`.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alshedivat/al-folio/master/assets/img/publications-screenshot.png" width=800></p>

<details><summary>(click to expand) <strong>Author annotation:</strong></summary>

In publications, the author entry for yourself is identified by string array `scholar:last_name` and string array `scholar:first_name` in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
scholar:
  last_name: [Einstein]
  first_name: [Albert, A.]
```

If the entry matches one form of the last names and the first names, it will be underlined.
Keep meta-information about your co-authors in `_data/coauthors.yml` and Jekyll will insert links to their webpages automatically.
The co-author data format in `_data/coauthors.yml` is as follows,

```yaml
"Adams":
  - firstname: ["Edwin", "E.", "E. P.", "Edwin Plimpton"]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Plimpton_Adams

"Podolsky":
  - firstname: ["Boris", "B.", "B. Y.", "Boris Yakovlevich"]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Podolsky

"Rosen":
  - firstname: ["Nathan", "N."]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rosen

"Bach":
  - firstname: ["Johann Sebastian", "J. S."]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach

  - firstname: ["Carl Philipp Emanuel", "C. P. E."]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach
```

If the entry matches one of the combinations of the last names and the first names, it will be highlighted and linked to the url provided.

</details>

<details><summary>(click to expand) <strong>Buttons (through custom bibtex keywords):</strong></summary>

There are several custom bibtex keywords that you can use to affect how the entries are displayed on the webpage:

- `abbr`: Adds an abbreviation to the left of the entry. You can add links to these by creating a venue.yaml-file in the _data folder and adding entries that match.
- `abstract`: Adds an "Abs" button that expands a hidden text field when clicked to show the abstract text
- `arxiv`: Adds a link to the Arxiv website (Note: only add the arxiv identifier here - the link is generated automatically)
- `bibtex_show`: Adds a "Bib" button that expands a hidden text field with the full bibliography entry
- `html`: Inserts an "HTML" button redirecting to the user-specified link
- `pdf`: Adds a "PDF" button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)
- `supp`: Adds a "Supp" button to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)
- `blog`: Adds a "Blog" button redirecting to the specified link
- `code`: Adds a "Code" button redirecting to the specified link
- `poster`: Adds a "Poster" button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)
- `slides`: Adds a "Slides" button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)
- `website`: Adds a "Website" button redirecting to the specified link
- `altmetric`: Adds an [Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/) badge (Note: if DOI is provided just use `true`, otherwise only add the altmetric identifier here - the link is generated automatically)
- `dimensions`: Adds a [Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai/) badge (Note: if DOI or PMID is provided just use `true`, otherwise only add the Dimensions' identifier here - the link is generated automatically)

You can implement your own buttons by editing the bib.html file.

### Collections

This Jekyll theme implements `collections` to let you break up your work into categories.
The theme comes with two default collections: `news` and `projects`.
Items from the `news` collection are automatically displayed on the home page.
Items from the `projects` collection are displayed on a responsive grid on projects page.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alshedivat/al-folio/master/assets/img/projects-screenshot.png" width=700></p>

You can easily create your own collections, apps, short stories, courses, or whatever your creative work is.
To do this, edit the collections in the `_config.yml` file, create a corresponding folder, and create a landing page for your collection, similar to `_pages/projects.md`.

---

### Layouts

**al-folio** comes with stylish layouts for pages and blog posts.

#### The iconic style of Distill

The theme allows you to create blog posts in the [distill.pub](https://distill.pub/) style:

<p align="center"><a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2021/distill/" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alshedivat/al-folio/master/assets/img/distill-screenshot.png" width=700></a></p>

For more details on how to create distill-styled posts using `<d-*>` tags, please refer to [the example](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2021/distill/).

#### Full support for math & code

**al-folio** supports fast math typesetting through [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) and code syntax highlighting using [GitHub style](https://github.com/jwarby/jekyll-pygments-themes):

<p align="center">
<a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2015/math/" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alshedivat/al-folio/master/assets/img/math-screenshot.png" width=400></a>
<a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2015/code/" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alshedivat/al-folio/master/assets/img/code-screenshot.png" width=400></a>
</p>

#### Photos

Photo formatting is made simple using [Bootstrap's grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/).
Easily create beautiful grids within your blog posts and project pages:

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/projects/1_project/">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alshedivat/al-folio/master/assets/img/photos-screenshot.png" width="75%">
  </a>
</p>

---

### Other features

#### GitHub's repositories and user stats

**al-folio** uses [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) and [github-profile-trophy](https://github.com/ryo-ma/github-profile-trophy)
to display GitHub repositories and user stats on the `/repositories/` page.

Edit the `_data/repositories.yml` and change the `github_users` and `github_repos` lists to include your own GitHub profile and repositories to the `/repositories/` page.

You may also use the following codes for displaying this in any other pages.

```html
<!-- code for GitHub users -->
{% if site.data.repositories.github_users %}
<div class="repositories d-flex flex-wrap flex-md-row flex-column justify-content-between align-items-center">
  {% for user in site.data.repositories.github_users %}
    {% include repository/repo_user.html username=user %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>
{% endif %}

<!-- code for GitHub trophies -->
{% if site.repo_trophies.enabled %}
{% for user in site.data.repositories.github_users %}
  {% if site.data.repositories.github_users.size > 1 %}
  <h4>{{ user }}</h4>
  {% endif %}
  <div class="repositories d-flex flex-wrap flex-md-row flex-column justify-content-between align-items-center">
  {% include repository/repo_trophies.html username=user %}
  </div>
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

<!-- code for GitHub repositories -->
{% if site.data.repositories.github_repos %}
<div class="repositories d-flex flex-wrap flex-md-row flex-column justify-content-between align-items-center">
  {% for repo in site.data.repositories.github_repos %}
    {% include repository/repo.html repository=repo %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>
{% endif %}
```

#### Theming

A variety of beautiful theme colors have been selected for you to choose from.
The default is purple, but you can quickly change it by editing the
`--global-theme-color` variable in the `_sass/_themes.scss` file.
Other color variables are listed there as well.
The stock theme color options available can be found at `_sass/_variables.scss`.
You can also add your own colors to this file assigning each a name for ease of
use across the template.

#### Social media previews

**al-folio** supports preview images on social media.
To enable this functionality you will need to set `serve_og_meta` to `true` in your `_config.yml`.
Once you have done so, all your site's pages will include Open Graph data in the HTML head element.

You will then need to configure what image to display in your site's social media previews.
This can be configured on a per-page basis, by setting the `og_image` page variable.
If for an individual page this variable is not set, then the theme will fall back to a site-wide `og_image` variable, configurable in your `_config.yml`.
In both the page-specific and site-wide cases, the `og_image` variable needs to hold the URL for the image you wish to display in social media previews.

#### Atom (RSS-like) Feed

It generates an Atom (RSS-like) feed of your posts, useful for Atom and RSS readers.
The feed is reachable simply by typing after your homepage `/feed.xml`.
E.g. assuming your website mountpoint is the main folder, you can type `yourusername.github.io/feed.xml`

#### Related posts

By default, there will be a related posts section on the bottom of the blog posts.
These are generated by selecting the `max_related` most recent posts that share at least `min_common_tags` tags with the current post.
If you do not want to display related posts on a specific post, simply add `related_posts: false` to the front matter of the post.
If you want to disable it for all posts, simply set `enabled` to false in the `related_blog_posts` section in `_config.yml`.
