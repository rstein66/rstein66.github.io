>I am passionate about software engineering and education. My interest in the intersection has guided my academic and professional path. I love how software engineering's rapid evolution encourages team members to be career-long learners and teachers. More broadly, I am inspired to integrate software engineering and educational methodology into an open, collaborative, and dynamic approach to implementing creative and practical solutions to real-world challenges.


### Education

In 2024, I completed a master's degree in [Specialized Studies in Education](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/degree/specialized-studies-education) at New York University. The program allowed me to design my studies. I focused on how technology can enhance learning in nonformal educational spaces (such as museums and libraries), taking courses such as  _Digital Frictions: Museum Accessibility_ and _Narrative, Digital Media, and Learning_. The [Projects](/projects/) page includes some of my graduate work, tagged as [`#nyu`](/projects/#nyu).

I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2015 with a bachelor's in computer science and minors in art history and education. Due to concerns about academic integrity, I cannot post my computer science projects. I worked as a software developer and consultant after thru-hiking the 2,200-mile Appalachian Trail from [Maine to Georgia](https://appalachiantrail.org/explore/hike-the-a-t/thru-hiking/southbound/). 

### Professional Background
 
I have worked primarily as a full-stack developer on projects, including building an iOS app for a national food delivery company, rebuilding a U.S. DoD system tracking recruits, and modernizing a telemedicine communication tool. At my last company, I focused on backend development, which included Ruby on Rails development, database support, and site stability. Before that, I worked as a software consultant. I valued the opportunities to practice the craft of software development, project management, and client-facing communication skills in an array of tech stacks and company cultures. All of the professional projects that I worked on are closed source.
