In fall 2023, I started a one-year master's program at New York University called [Specialized Studies in Education](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/degree/specialized-studies-education). The program allows me to design my studies. I focus on how technology can enhance, rather than replace, in-person learning in nonformal education spaces (such as museums and libraries). I am particularly passionate about working with children.Â 

I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2015 with a bachelor's in computer science and minors in art history and education. I worked as a software developer and consultant for six years after thru-hiking the 2,200-mile [Appalachian Trail](https://appalachiantrail.org/explore/hike-the-a-t/) from [Maine to Georgia](https://appalachiantrail.org/explore/hike-the-a-t/thru-hiking/southbound/).

I am drawn to how education and software development can work together to foster an open, collaborative, dynamic culture and focus on implementing creative and practical solutions for real-world challenges.
 

<!--  ### Professional Background

<details>
<br />
I have worked primarily as a full-stack developer on projects, including building an iOS app for a national food delivery company, rebuilding a U.S. DoD system tracking new recruits, and modernizing a telemedicine communication tool. At my last company, I focused on backend development, which included Ruby on Rails development, database support, and site stability. Before that, I worked for several years as a software consultant. I valued the opportunities to practice the crafts of software development, project management, and client-facing communication skills in an array of tech stacks and company cultures.
