>I am passionate about software engineering and education. My interest in the intersection has guided my academic and professional path. I love how software engineering's rapid evolution encourages team members to be career-long learners and teachers. More broadly, I am inspired to integrate software engineering and educational methodology into an open, collaborative, and dynamic approach to implementing creative and practical solutions to real-world challenges.


### Educational Background

In 2024, I completed a master's degree in [Specialized Studies in Education](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/degree/specialized-studies-education) at New York University. The program allowed me to design my studies. I focused on how technology can enhance in-person learning. While I primarily focused on nonformal spaces (such as museums and libraries), my work was also readily applicable to both virtual and formal educational spaces. For example, my _Museum Education_ course greatly informed my semester project for _Foundations of Curriculum for Diverse Learners_ (see my ["How do you rest?"](/projects/udl-rest-lesson/) project). The [Projects](/projects/) page includes more of my graduate work, tagged as [`#nyu`](/projects/#nyu).

I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2015 with a bachelor's in computer science and minors in art history and education. Due to concerns about academic integrity, I cannot post my computer science projects. I worked as a software developer and consultant after thru-hiking the 2,200-mile Appalachian Trail from [Maine to Georgia](https://appalachiantrail.org/explore/hike-the-a-t/thru-hiking/southbound/).

### Professional Background
 
I have worked primarily as a full-stack developer on projects, including building an iOS app for a national food delivery company, rebuilding a U.S. DoD system tracking recruits, and modernizing a telemedicine communication tool. At my last company, The Mom Project, I focused on backend development, which included Ruby on Rails development, database support, and site stability. Before that, I worked as a software consultant. I valued the opportunities to practice the craft of software development, project management, and client-facing communication skills in an array of tech stacks and company cultures. Every industry project I worked on is closed source.
