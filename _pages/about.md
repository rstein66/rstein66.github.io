<!-- I am passionate about software development and education. I am drawn to how they are well-suited to work together to foster an open, collaborative and dynamic culture, and focus on implementing creative and practical solutions for real-world challenges.  -->


In fall 2023, I started a one-year MA program in [Specialized Studies in Education](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/degree/specialized-studies-education) at New York University. The program allows me to design my studies. I focus on how technology can enhance, rather than replace, in-person learning in non-formal education spaces (such as museums and libraries).

<!-- ### Professional Background

<details>
<br />
I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science and minors in Art History and Educational Studies.
I have worked primarily as a full-stack developer on projects, including building an iOS app for a national food delivery company, rebuilding a U.S. DoD system tracking new recruits, and modernizing a telemedicine communication tool. At my last company, I focused on backend development, which included Ruby on Rails development, database support, and site stability. Before that, I worked for several years as a software consultant. I valued the opportunities to practice the crafts of software development, project management, and client-facing communication skills in an array of tech stacks and company cultures.
