## Physical Trail

The A.T. covers about 2,200 mi. Before I hiked it, I did not appreciate how close you are to civilization. Even the famed [100-Mile Wilderness](https://thetrek.co/the-complete-hiker-trash-guide-to-the-100-mile-wilderness/) in Maine, the most remote section of the trail, wasn't all that remote. While there's little infrastructure, you pass by driveways to summer homes and lakes where families go for a day trip. Nor did I appreciate how different the trail itself could look. Some examples are shown below. 

<!-- üìå TODO

    also, more often blazed with NOBO's in mind

## Some Takeaways

- It was a privileged to be able to thru-hike the trail and an amazing experience that I will never forget. That said, practicalities aside, there is a lot to be said for doing the trail in sections. For example, people who visit [Shenandoah National Park](https://www.nps.gov/shen/index.htm) or the [Great Smoky Mountains National Park](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm) often talk about how stunning and memorable the park was‚Äìespecially the sunsets. But, when you thru-hiking you have similar views for hundreds on miles. Sometimes it was difficult not to take them for granted.      
  
- Post offices are the best! Public libraries are the pretty great too!  ==üìå TODO finish!==
