## Overview

As part of Swarthmore College's 2013â€“14 and 2014-15 WiCS club leadership teams, I helped organize events including weekly lunches for female students and faculty, lightening talks, and workshops. As the first webmaster, I also created the club's website. In addition to club information, I complied resources and testimonialsâ€“including from former club members in industry and CS PhD programs.  

The club was created in 2011 and chartered in 2013. Membership was open to all female TriCo students. Most events, including those described below, were open to all TriCo students (regardless of gender, academic major, or course enrollment).

## Binary Crowns

One of my favorite events was "binary crown making."  

> For a brief introduction to what "binary" means in context, see ["Why is binary important?"](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/binary#:~:text=Why%20Is%20Binary,or%20store%20information.) by Built In.

### Inspiration


VMWare "Code Princess" t-shirt that VMWare distributed at the [2013 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference](https://ghc.anitab.org/ghc-2013-a-big-success/).<sup>\* </sup> (I was fortunately enough to be a Grace Hopper \[Student\] Scholar that year, and many other club members were awarded other scholarships to the conference.) The shirt's design is shown in the right-hand image below. 

<div class="subnote">* The conference has since expanded to focus on gathering, supporting, and empowering women <i>and</i> nonbinary workers in an <i>array</i> of tech roles. I included the conference's full name to explain why the shirt's theme was very likely a well intentioned (albeit problematic) choice.</div>  


### Event

With the t-shirt's _crown_ as inspiration, the event was a social opportunity for students to socialize and eat provided food while creating their own crown formed from 1s and 0s using foam sheets, foam letters, gem stickers, glue, and such.

## Open Source Workshop

PS I wanted to briefly mention another of my favorite WiCS events: [OpenHatch](https://blog.openhatch.org/)'s "Open Source Comes to Campus" in 2014.
