## Overview

As part of my college's 2013â€“2015 WiCS (Women in Computer Science) club leadership team (I was webmaster), I had the privileged of helping to organize events ranging from 

weekly lunch's  
lightening talks

These events were open to Swarthmore College students regardless of gender, major, or course enrollment.


## Binary Crowns

One of my favorite events was "binary crown making."  

> For a brief introduction to what "binary" means in context, see ["Why is binary important?"](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/binary#:~:text=Why%20Is%20Binary,or%20store%20information.) by Built In.

### Inspiration


VMWare "Code Princess" t-shirt that VMWare distributed at the [2013 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference](https://ghc.anitab.org/ghc-2013-a-big-success/).<sup>\* </sup> (I was fortunately enough to be a Grace Hopper \[Student\] Scholar that year, and many other club members were awarded other scholarships to the conference.) The shirt's design is shown to the right below. 


### The Event

Using the shirt as inspiration, 
to celebrate 

Foam sheets, foam letters, \[fake\] gem stickers, glue, and such.  


<div class="subnote">* The conference has since expanded to focus on gathering, supporting, and empowering women <i>and</i> nonbinary workers in an <i>array</i> of tech roles. I included the conference's full name to explain why the shirt's theme, "princesses who coded," was very likely a well intentioned (albeit problematic) choice.</div>
