## SWiCS

As part of Swarthmore College's 2013–14 and 2014–15 WiCS leadership, I helped organize events like weekly lunches for female students and faculty, lightning talks, and workshops. As the first webmaster, I created the club's website and compiled resources and testimonials from alumni in industry and academia.  

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        The club was founded in 2011 and chartered in 2013. Membership was open to all female TriCo<sup>* </sup> students. Most events, including those described below, were open to all TriCo students regardless of gender, academic major, or course enrollment.

## Binary Crown Making

> ℹ️ For a very brief introduction to **binary**, see ["Why is binary important?"](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/binary#:~:text=Why%20Is%20Binary,or%20store%20information.) by Built In.

One of my favorite events was binary crown making.

### Inspiration


VMWare distributed "Code Princess" shirts at the [2013 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference](https://ghc.anitab.org/ghc-2013-a-big-success/),<sup>\* </sup> which I attended as a Grace Hopper \[Student\] Scholar. The shirt's design is shown in the right-hand image below.

<div class="subnote">* The conference has since expanded to focus on gathering, supporting, and empowering women <i>and</i> nonbinary workers in an <i>array</i> of tech roles. I included the conference's full name to clarify why the shirt's theme was likely a well-intentioned (albeit problematic) choice.</div>  


### Event

Inspired by the shirt's _crown_, the event provided a social opportunity for all students to socialize and enjoy food while creating crowns from 1s and 0s using foam sheets, foam letters, gem stickers, glue, and more.

## Open Source Workshop

PS: I wanted to quickly mention another favorite event of mine—[OpenHatch](https://blog.openhatch.org/)'s Open Source Comes to Campus in 2014.

- The events' funding was primarily provided by the Swarthmore CS department.
