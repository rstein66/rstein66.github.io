> By [Alyssa Cohen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssa-cohen-9abb25230/) and Rachel Stein


The division of labor broke down roughly as follows: Alyssa focused on the anthropology. I (Rachel) focused on design. We paired on implementation.  

This project was initially created for NYU Museum Studies' graduate course [Digital Frictions - Museum Accessibility and Digital Design](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/museumstudies/courses/spring-2024-course-schedule.html) (Spring 2024).


**Shorthand:**

- AMNH ‚Äì _American Museum of Natural History_
- Hall ‚Äì _Hall of Human Origins_



## Concept Overview

This project complements the Neanderthal diorama in the [Hall of Human Origins](https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/human-origins) (Hall) at the [American Museum of Natural History](https://www.amnh.org/) (AMNH) in New York City. 

Our intervention aims to promote scientific literacy by helping visitors imagine scientifically realistic alternatives for what Neanderthals looked like and how they behaved.

## Statement of Need

The human evolution dioramas in the Hall are meant to help visitors visualize what our hominid ancestors looked like and how they behaved in their respective environments. Their goal is to bring [paleoanthropological](https://www.britannica.com/science/paleoanthropology#:~:text=Paleoanthropology%2C%20interdisciplinary%20branch%20of%20anthropology,and%20the%20theory%20of%20evolution.) evidence to life. However, visitors can easily misinterpret the dioramas‚Äô realism as objective truth. In reality, the dioramas are scientifically informed artistic tableaux resulting from the work of scientists and sculptors. Currently, the AMNH does not help visitors understand this‚Äìat least in this exhibition.



## Target Audience

This project is intended for the general public visiting the Hall in person.

### Why Neanderthals?

<!-- üìå TODO finish -->
This project focuses on the Neanderthal (formally, Homo neanderthalensis) ...

<!-- mention Night at the Museum? -->

**_Some_ known unknowns about neanderthals:**

- <u>Skin color</u>
- Amount of <u>body hair</u>
- <u>Eyelid</u> shape
- <u>Nose</u> cartilage shape
- <u>Clothing</u>: dependent on regional factors, such as weather + available resources
- <u>Diet</u>: dependent on regional availability of flora and fauna
- <u>Shelters</u>: (e.g., caves, rocky outcrops)
- <u>Facial hair</u> grooming (e.g., may have used obsidian as razors)


<!-- TODO word choice below -->

**Note:** We tried to avoid changing racial features, not only because we want to keep it accurate in terms of the location of the site in France, but we do not want to unintentionally replicate something like blackface

<!-- **Evidence-Backed? Artistic Influence? Ingrained Racism and Biases?** -->


### Physical Setup

**What is Hologauze?**

According to Holotronica, the makers of Hologauze: 

<p class="quote">
    "Hologauze<sup>¬Æ</sup> is the original and best solution for creating large-scale holographic illusions with digital projection. Hologauze<sup>¬Æ</sup> is the only patented and fully silvered projection gauze available with unparalleled levels of transparency, brightness, contrast, and viewing angle range." 
    ‚Äì <a href="https://www.holotronica.com/hologauze/" target="_blank">Holotronica</a>
</p>

In practice, we use the branded product as a generic stand-in for holographic gauze that supports high-quality digital projections (think ‚ÄúKleenex‚Äù for ‚Äúfacial tissues‚Äù). Because cost and similar factors were not part of our class project, we could choose a highly regarded product without in-depth product research or comparisons, including costs (e.g., material and setup costs, energy consumption).

**Why did we choose digital projection?**

<!-- TODO!!!! -->

**How will we use the projection?**

A Hologauze screen will be placed directly behind the diorama's glass. Every five minutes, a video will project images onto the Hologauze, visually altering the Neanderthal mannequins and their environment. Visitors will scan a QR code, bringing them to a web page with two versions of the accompanying audio narration. One version will include an audio description (for blind and low-vision visitors), and the other will not. The page will also include a verbal description of the diorama for blind and low-vision visitors and a transcript for d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing visitors. Captions will appear at the top of the Hologauze screen (surtitles). The audio narration will sync with the video, only starting when the video begins.

<!-- ### Proposed Visitor Flow -->



## Accessibility

Our delivery method reduces but does not eliminate friction for all visitors by asking far less of them. For example, they will not need to click through menus. Our intervention aims to be self-explanatory to visually dependent visitors (i.e., sighted visitors). Still, we hope they will listen to the audio or read the transcript to enhance their experience. Regrettably, visitors with low vision or blindness still need their smartphones. The exhibition is too compact and crowded to play the audio ‚Äúout loud.‚Äù Doing so might also increase friction for some visitors with sonic frictions. Relatedly, we worry that adding captions for visitors with reduced hearing or deafness might make the display more overwhelming. Currently, our imperfect solution is to provide a transcript under the audio. Both are accessed through a large color-contrasting QR code with sonic and haptic cues.

### Intro scene

<p class="transcript">Here, we have a 50,000-year-old Neanderthal campsite that archaeologists found in western France. But how do you know that what you're looking at is real? It might not be. Scientists used a lot of real evidence to create this scene, but how they interpret it might be wrong. Let's explore some other realistic possibilities... following scientific evidence, of course!</p>

### Hair scene

<p class="scene-direction">[Hair changes appear on the mannequins one by one when mentioned.]</p>

<p class="transcript">Let's start with their hair. Scientists can't know what color every Neanderthal's hair was or how they styled it. DNA gives us clues but not exact answers. Like us, some Neanderthals had brown hair that they braided. Some were bald with red beards. Others had graying short hair.</p>

### Clothing scenes

<p class="scene-direction">[New items appear when named.]</p>

<p class="transcript">Did Neanderthals wear clothes? Probably. We know they sewed with needles made of animal bones. In this scene, the female in the middle is preparing an animal hide, probably to make clothes. During the hot French summer, a female might have worn a light dress or a straw hat to protect her from the sun. Neanderthals at least wore underwear. <span class="audio-description">{Boxers with pink hearts appear on the male Neanderthal.}</span> Oops! It's 50,000 years too early for those.</p>

### Food scene

<p class="scene-direction">[Mannequins repositioned. Animal hide disappears.]<br>[New items appear when named.]</p>

<p class="transcript">During the summer in France, scientists think Neanderthals gathered fruits, nuts, and seeds. They knew how to use fire and maybe cooked up some fish for dinner.</p>

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">

<p class="scene-direction">[Display returns to default state.]</p>


### Recreation scene

<p class="scene-direction">[Animal hide and spear disappear.]<br>[New items appear when named.]</p>

There's evidence that Neanderthals had rituals. Maybe they collected flowers or played music for a special ceremony. The first human-made instruments were flutes, so maybe Neanderthals played them too.

### Family scene

<p class="scene-direction">[Mannequins repositioned. Animal hide and spear disappear.]<br>[New items appear when named.]</p>

Like us, Neanderthals had fun with their families and took care of each other. Can you imagine a mom watching her toddler play while grandma holds his baby sister and dad tells dad jokes?

### Outro scene

<p class="scene-direction">[Display fades to black.]<br>[Images similar to those below appear as the narrator speaks.]</p>

<p class="transcript">Just like humans, Neanderthals had different skin tones, diets, and cultures based on where they lived. With the archaeological and DNA evidence we have <em>today</em>, we don't know everything about our evolutionary cousins. Scientists use evidence to help us imagine realistic possibilities, but unless we have a time machine, we can't know for sure! Who knows, with new scientific technology and discoveries, maybe we'll get more answers soon!</p>

## Future Work

<!-- üö® FIXME !!  -->

If we were to continue this project, tasks that we would like to focus on are listed below.

**Content**  

1. ‚≠êÔ∏è <u>Shorten script</u> - 
2. Add additional <u>audio description</u> to the script
3. Add verbal <u>description of diorama</u>
4. Add an article with educational content about Neanderthals, paleoanthropology and paleogenetics

**Work with**
    
- <u>Anthropologists</u> to verify accuracy - _For example, in the [Recreation scene](#recreation-scene), use flowers that likely grew in western France approximately 50,000 years ago._
- <u>Designers</u> - I am not a designer. The [¬ß Storyboard](#storyboard) scenes and [web page](#web-page) designs would greatly benefit from professional expertises.  
- Improve accessibility by soliciting feedback from \[paid] <u>disability consultants</u>, which needs to include people with blindness, low-vision, deafness, and so forth.

- Figure out a more seamless way to integrate the audio narration


**Physical layout**   
- Can a <u>bench or stools</u> be added to allow people to sit while watching the video? ‚Äì _This would improve accessibility, and likely visitor engagement, but the exhibition is very compact._
- Can the panels on either side of the diorama be relocated to give viewers <u>more space</u>? (see [Physical Setup](#physical-setup))  
- Consider <u>applying Hologauze</u> to the other dioramas in exhibition ‚Äì _Will visitors expect and be disappointed that only one diorama is "animated"?_
