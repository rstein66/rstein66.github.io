> By [Alyssa Cohen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssa-cohen-9abb25230/) and Rachel Stein


The division of labor broke down roughly as follows: Alyssa focused on the anthropology. I (Rachel) focused on design. We paired on implementation.  

This project was initially created for NYU Museum Studies' graduate course [Digital Frictions - Museum Accessibility and Digital Design](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/museumstudies/courses/spring-2024-course-schedule.html) (Spring 2024).


## Concept Overview

<!-- This is the big picture of what you are trying to achieve with the project. 
(Ex: Young adults struggle with self-worth and mental health challenges. 
This project uses a game where emotions like coping, optimism and asking for help are a part of the learning). -->


This project complements the Neanderthal diorama in the [Hall of Human Origins](https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/human-origins) at the [American Museum of Natural History](https://www.amnh.org/) (AMNH) in New York City. 

Our intervention aims to promote scientific literacy by helping visitors imagine scientifically realistic alternatives for what Neanderthals looked like and how they behaved. 

A Hologauze screen will be placed directly behind the diorama's glass. Every five minutes, a video will project images onto the Hologauze, visually altering the Neanderthal mannequins and their environment. Visitors will scan a QR code, bringing them to a web page with two versions of the accompanying audio narration. One version will include an audio description (for blind and low-vision visitors), and the other will not. The site will also include a verbal description of the diorama for blind and low-vision visitors and a transcript for d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing visitors. Captions will appear at the top of the Hologauze screen. The audio narration will sync with the video, only starting when the video begins.

### Why Neanderthals?
  
> ##### ⚠️ NOTE ON ACCURARCY
>
> The study of early modern humans is an extremely active and rapidly evolving 
> field. Therefore:  
> 
> - Reputable resources may have conflicting information, 
> depending on when they were last updated. 
> - While this project makes a concerted effort to reflect the current 
> state of research as of April 2024 (see [§ Works Consulted](#works-consulted)\),
> its focus is on museum accessibility and digital design, _not_ anthropology.

[§ Storyboard](#storyboard) below focuses on

This project focuses on the Neanderthals because...


**_Some_ known unknowns about neanderthals:**

- <u>Skin color</u>
- Amount of <u>body hair</u>
- <u>Eyelid</u> shape
- <u>Nose</u> cartilage shape
- <u>Clothing</u>: dependent on regional factors, such as weather + available resources
- <u>Diet</u>: dependent on regional availability of flora and fauna
- <u>Shelters</u>: (e.g., caves, rocky outcrops)
- <u>Facial hair</u> grooming (e.g., may have used obsidian as razors)


<!-- TODO word choice below -->

**Note:** We tried to avoid changing racial features, not only because we want to keep it accurate in terms of the location of the site in France, but we do not want to unintentionally replicate something like blackface


### Physical Setup

**Why Hologauze?**

- no budget

### Intro scene

<p class="transcript">Here, we have a 50,000-year-old Neanderthal campsite that archaeologists found in western France. But how do you know that what you're looking at is real? It might not be. Scientists used a lot of real evidence to create this scene, but the way they interpret that evidence might be wrong. Let's explore some other possibilities that are just as realistic as this scene... following scientific evidence of course!</p>

<div class="caption">
    Default state. 
</div>

### Hair scene

<p class="scene-direction">[Hair changes appear on the mannequins one by one as the narrator mentions each. The changes disappear at the end of the scene.]</p>

<p class="transcript">Let's start with their hair. Scientists can't know what color every Neanderthal's hair was or how they styled it. DNA gives us clues but not exact answers. Like us, some Neanderthals had brown hair that they braided. Some were bald with red beards. Others had graying short hair.</p>

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/msms-ne-album/scene-01-hair.jpg" alt="::ADD ALT TEXT!::" class="img-fluid rounded" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

<p class="scene-direction">[Display returns to default state.]</p>

### Clothing scenes

<p class="scene-direction">[Clothing appears when the narrator names the item.]</p>

<p class="transcript">Did Neanderthals wear clothes? Probably. We know they sewed with needles made of animal bones. In this scene, the female in the middle is preparing an animal hide, probably to make clothes. During the hot French summer, a female might have worn a light dress or a straw hat to protect her from the sun. Neanderthals at least wore underwear. <span class="audio-description">{Boxers with pink hearts appear on the male Neanderthal.}</span> Oops! It's 50,000 years too early for those.</p>

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/msms-ne-album/scene-02-clothing-boxers.jpg" alt="::ADD ALT TEXT!::" class="img-fluid rounded" zoomable=true %}

<span class="audio-description">{The boxers are replaced with a beige loin cloth.}</span> <span class="transcript">Much better!</span>

</div>

<p class="scene-direction">[Display returns to default state.]</p>


### Food scene

<p class="scene-direction">[Items appear when narrator names them. All changes disappear at the end of the scene.]</p>

<p class="transcript">During the summer in France, scientists think Neanderthals gathered fruits, nuts, and seeds. They knew how to use fire and maybe cooked up some fish for dinner.</p>

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/msms-ne-album/scene-04-food.jpg" alt="::ADD ALT TEXT!::" class="img-fluid rounded" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

<p class="scene-direction">[Display returns to default state.]</p>


### Recreation scene

There's evidence that Neanderthals had rituals. Maybe, they collected flowers or played music for a special ceremony. The first human-made instruments were flutes, so maybe Neanderthals played them too.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/msms-ne-album/scene-05-rec.jpg" alt="::ADD ALT TEXT!::" class="img-fluid rounded" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

<p class="scene-direction">[Display returns to default state.]</p>


### Family scene

Like us, Neanderthals had fun with their families and took care of each other. Can you imagine a mom watching her toddler play while grandma holds his baby sister and dad tells dad jokes?

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/msms-ne-album/scene-06-family.jpg" alt="::ADD ALT TEXT!::" class="img-fluid rounded" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

<p class="scene-direction">[Display returns to default state.]</p>


### Outro scene

<p class="scene-direction">[Images similar to those above appear on the screen against a black background as the narrator speaks. The whole screen fades to black and then becomes transparent to reveal the physical diorama.]</p>

<p class="transcript">Just like humans, Neanderthals had different skin tones, diets, and cultures based on where they lived. With the archaeological and DNA evidence we have <em>today</em>, we don't know everything about our evolutionary cousins. Scientists use evidence to help us imagine realistic possibilities, but unless we have a time machine, we can't know for sure! Who knows, with new scientific technology and discoveries, maybe we'll get more answers soon!</p>

<p class="scene-direction">[Display returns to default state.]</p>

## Future Work

<!-- 🚨 FIXME !!  -->

If we were to continue this project, tasks that we would like to focus on are listed below.

**Content**  

1. ⭐️ <u>Shorten script</u> - 
2. Add additional <u>audio description</u> to the script
3. Add verbal <u>description of diorama</u>
4. Add an article with educational content about Neanderthals, paleoanthropology and paleogenetics

**Work with**
    
- <u>Anthropologists</u> to verify accuracy - _For example, in the [Recreation scene](#recreation-scene), use flowers that likely grew in western France approximately 50,000 years ago._
- <u>Designers</u> - I am not a designer. The [Storyboard](#storyboard) scenes and [web page](#web-page) designs would greatly benefit from professional expertises.  
- Improve accessibility by soliciting feedback from \[paid] <u>disability consultants</u>, which needs to include people with blindness, low-vision, deafness, and so forth.




- Figure out a more seamless way to integrate the audio narration


  
**Physical layout**   
- Can a <u>bench or stools</u> be added to allow people to sit while watching the video? – _This would improve accessibility, and likely visitor engagement, but the exhibition is very compact._
- Can the panels on either side of the diorama be relocated to give viewers <u>more space</u>? (see [Physical Setup](#physical-setup))  
- Consider <u>applying Hologauze</u> to the other dioramas in exhibition – _Will visitors expect and be disappointed that only one diorama is "animated"?_
