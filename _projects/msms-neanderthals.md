> By [Alyssa Cohen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssa-cohen-9abb25230/) and Rachel Stein

This project was initially created for NYU Museum Studies' graduate course [Digital Frictions - Museum Accessibility and Digital Design](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/museumstudies/courses/spring-2024-course-schedule.html) (Spring 2024).


## Concept Overview

<!-- This is the big picture of what you are trying to achieve with the project. 
(Ex: Young adults struggle with self-worth and mental health challenges. 
This project uses a game where emotions like coping, optimism and asking for help are a part of the learning). -->


This project complements the Neanderthal diorama in the [Hall of Human Origins](https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/human-origins) at the [American Museum of Natural History](https://www.amnh.org/) (AMNH) in New York City. 

Our intervention aims to promote scientific literacy by helping visitors imagine scientifically realistic alternatives for what Neanderthals looked like and how they behaved. 

A Hologauze screen will be placed directly behind the diorama's glass. Every five minutes, a video will project images onto the Hologauze, visually altering the Neanderthal mannequins and their environment. Visitors will scan a QR code, bringing them to a web page with two versions of the accompanying audio narration. One version will include an audio description (for blind and low-vision visitors), and the other will not. The site will also include a verbal description of the diorama for blind and low-vision visitors and a transcript for d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing visitors. Captions will appear at the top of the Hologauze screen. The audio narration will sync with the video, only starting when the video begins.

### Which Diorama?


### Why Neanderthals?


**_Some_ Unknowns<sup> [\[1\]](#research-note)</sup> About Neanderthals**

- <u>Skin color</u>
- Amount of <u>body hair</u>
- <u>Eyelid</u> shape
- <u>Nose</u> cartilage shape
- <u>Clothing</u>: dependent on regional factors, such as weather + available resources
- <u>Diet</u>: dependent on regional availability of flora and fauna
- <u>Shelters</u>: (e.g., caves, rocky outcrops)
- <u>Facial hair</u> grooming (e.g., may have used obsidian as razors)


<!-- TODO word choice below -->

**Note:** We tried to avoid changing racial features, not only because we want to keep it accurate in terms of the location of the site in France, but we do not want to unintentionally replicate something like blackface

Neanderthals lived in Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. They appeared about 400,000 years ago and became extinct 40,000 years ago.

### Intro

Here, we have a 50,000-year-old Neanderthal campsite that archaeologists found in western France. But how do you know that what you're looking at is real? It might not be. Scientists used a lot of real evidence to create this scene, but the way they interpret that evidence might be wrong. Let's explore some other possibilities that are just as realistic as this scene... following scientific evidence of course!



### Hair scene

<p class="scene-direction">[Hair changes appear on the mannequins one by one as the narrator mentions each. The changes disappear at the end of the scene.]</p>

Let's start with their hair. Scientists can't know what color every Neanderthal's hair was or how they styled it. DNA gives us clues but not exact answers. Like us, some Neanderthals had brown hair that they braided. Some were bald with red beards. Others had graying short hair.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ne-album/scene-01-hair.jpg" alt="::ADD ALT TEXT!::" class="img-fluid rounded" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>


### Clothing scenes

<p class="scene-direction">[Clothing appears when the narrator names the item.]</p>

Did Neanderthals wear clothes? Probably. We know they sewed with needles made of animal bones. In this scene, the female in the middle is preparing an animal hide, probably to make clothes. During the hot French summer, a female might have worn a light dress or a straw hat to protect her from the sun. Neanderthals at least wore underwear. <span class="audio-description">{Boxers with pink hearts flash onto the male Neanderthal.}</span> Oops! It's 50,000 years too early for those.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ne-album/scene-02-clothing-boxers.jpg" alt="::ADD ALT TEXT!::" class="img-fluid rounded" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

<span class="audio-description">{The boxers are replaced with a beige loin cloth.}</span> Much better!

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ne-album/scene-03-clothing-loincloth.jpg" alt="::ADD ALT TEXT!::" class="img-fluid rounded" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

<p class="scene-direction">[All clothing items disappear.]</p>

### Food scene

<p class="scene-direction">[Items appear when narrator names them. All changes disappear at the end of the scene.]</p>

During the summer in France, scientists think Neanderthals gathered fruits, nuts, and seeds. They knew how to use fire and maybe cooked up some fish for dinner.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ne-album/scene-04-food.jpg" alt="::ADD ALT TEXT!::" class="img-fluid rounded" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>


### Recreation scene

There's evidence that Neanderthals had rituals. Maybe, they collected flowers or played music for a special ceremony. The first human-made instruments were flutes, so maybe Neanderthals played them too.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ne-album/scene-05-rec.jpg" alt="::ADD ALT TEXT!::" class="img-fluid rounded" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>


### Family scene

Like us, Neanderthals had fun with their families and took care of each other. Can you imagine a mom watching her toddler play while grandma holds his baby sister and dad tells dad jokes?

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ne-album/scene-06-family.jpg" alt="::ADD ALT TEXT!::" class="img-fluid rounded" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>


### Outro

<p class="scene-direction">[Images similar to those above flash on the screen against a black background as the narrator speaks. The whole screen fades to black and then becomes transparent to reveal the physical diorama.]</p>

Just like humans, Neanderthals had different skin tones, diets, and cultures based on where they lived. With the archaeological and DNA evidence we have _today_, we don't know everything about our evolutionary cousins. Scientists use evidence to help us imagine realistic possibilities, but unless we have a time machine, we can't know for sure! Who knows, with new scientific technology and discoveries, maybe we'll get more answers soon!

## Next Steps

<!-- 🚨 FIXME !!  -->

- **Check for accuracy** (e.g., types of flora and fauna)

- Verbal description of diorama
- Audio description

- Edit and shorten the script
- Professional photo edits & webpage design 
- Solicit feedback from blind, low-vision, d/Deaf, and hard of hearing visitors to improve the experience

- Figure out a more seamless way to integrate the audio narration
- A web page with educational content about Neanderthals, paleoanthropology and paleogenetics


- Apply Hologauze to the other three dioramas in exhibit?
