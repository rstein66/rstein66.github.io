> By [Alyssa Cohen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssa-cohen-9abb25230/) and Rachel Stein

This project was initially created for NYU Museum Studies' graduate course [Digital Frictions - Museum Accessibility and Digital Design](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/museumstudies/courses/spring-2024-course-schedule.html) (Spring 2024).


## Concept Overview

<!-- This is the big picture of what you are trying to achieve with the project. 
(Ex: Young adults struggle with self-worth and mental health challenges. 
This project uses a game where emotions like coping, optimism and asking for help are a part of the learning). -->


This project complements the Neanderthal diorama in the [Hall of Human Origins](https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/human-origins) at the [American Museum of Natural History](https://www.amnh.org/) (AMNH) in New York City. 

Our intervention aims to promote scientific literacy by helping visitors imagine scientifically realistic alternatives for what Neanderthals looked like and how they behaved. 

A Hologauze screen will be placed directly behind the diorama's glass. Every five minutes, a video will project images onto the Hologauze, visually altering the Neanderthal mannequins and their environment. Visitors will scan a QR code, bringing them to a web page with two versions of the accompanying audio narration. One version will include an audio description (for blind and low-vision visitors), and the other will not. The site will also include a verbal description of the diorama for blind and low-vision visitors and a transcript for d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing visitors. Captions will appear at the top of the Hologauze screen. The audio narration will sync with the video, only starting when the video begins.

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ne-album/scene-00-original.jpg" alt="::ADD ALT TEXT!::" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

### Hair scene

<p class="scene-direction">[Hair changes appear on the mannequins one by one as the narrator mentions each. The changes disappear at the end of the scene.]</p>

Let's start with their hair. Scientists can't know what color every Neanderthal's hair was or how they styled it. DNA gives us clues but not exact answers. Like us, some Neanderthals had brown hair that they braided. Some were bald with red beards. Others had graying short hair.

## Next Steps

<!-- üö® FIXME !!  -->

- **Check for accuracy** (e.g., types of flora and fauna)

- Solicit feedback from blind, low-vision, d/Deaf, and hard of hearing visitors to improve the experience
- Edit and shorten the script
- Professional image generation
- Figure out a more seamless way to integrate the audio narration
- A web page with educational content about Neanderthals, paleoanthropology and paleogenetics
- Apply Hologauze to the other three dioramas in exhibit?
