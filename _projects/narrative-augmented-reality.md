### Concept Overview

It is difficult to understate the catastrophic devastation of human activity on Earth's biodiversity, especially in the last several hundred years. This human-driven annihilation is often called the "sixth extinction"<sup> [\[1\]](#extinction-resources)</sup>.  The Spectrum of Extinction (SoE) project forefronts this extinction to visitors to New York City's world-famous [American Museum of Natural History](https://www.amnh.org/) (AMNH), one of the renowned museum's most iconic permanent exhibitions, the [Spectrum of Life](https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/biodiversity/spectrum-of-life") (SoL).



### Statement of Need

<!-- Statement of Need/Problem or Design Challenge
_What are you trying to solve?_ -->

Walking into the AMNH's [Hall of Biodiversity](https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/biodiversity) (HoB), SoL is one of the first things to catch visitors' eyes. Unsurprisingly so, given that 

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"> 
    "The Spectrum of Life in the Hall of Biodiversity is an evolutionary trip through the amazing diversity of life on Earth. The 1,500 specimens represent a wide range [of life]... The only one of its kind in the world, this 100-foot-long installation is arranged into 28 living groups covering 3.5 billion years of evolution.

In the shadow of the HoB's other icon sight, the Rain Forest Diorama, is a narrow and dimly lit corridor home to the Transformation of the Biosphere Wall. According to the official HoB educator's guide<sup> [\[2\]](#educator-guide)</sup>, this wall focuses on "human effects on the environment" and "examines the root causes of biodiversity loss—population growth and overconsumption."


### Target Audience

Smart phones now ubiquitous. 

They

There are drawbacks, of course. It requires people to have smartphones. While this can be mitigated by allowing visitors to borrow phones, it still assumes familiarity and comfort with their use. Further, using their phones means people look "down" at it. They are literally looking at the exhibit from a more limited viewpoint, rarer than taking it in as a whole. Staring at the smaller screen also makes sharing the experience with their fellow visitors more challenging.

Ideally, this would be integrated into the AMNH's existing mobile application or mobile website to avoid the need to install (and maintain) a separate mobile application.
