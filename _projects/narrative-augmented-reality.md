### Concept Overview

<!-- This is the big picture of what you are trying to achieve with the project. 
(Ex: Young adults struggle with self-worth and mental health challenges.

The only one of its kind in the world, this 100-foot-long installation is arranged into 28 living groups covering 3.5 billion years of evolution.
