### Concept Overview


<!-- _This is the big picture of what you are trying to achieve with the project. 
(Ex: Young adults struggle with self-worth and mental health challenges. 
This project uses a game where emotions like coping, optimism and asking for help are a part of the learning)._
 -->

_Brooklyn Kids_ gives children the freedom to "choose their own adventure" when exploring the [Brooklyn Children's Museum](https://www.brooklynkids.org/) in [Brooklyn, New York](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rYMesQ8Xb2M3hkEx8). The child avatar, named Kit, partners with one of the museum's (imaginary) residents, Ollie the Otter.

### Concept Description

<!-- Tell me here about the overall project and why you chose the media for this project. Perhaps you tell a little about why you think this works for your audience._ -->

::TODO::

  
### Target Audience

Children (approximately 4-8 years old) will soon visit, or who have recently visited, the Brooklyn Children's Museum. 

Longer-term vision to better support this audience:

- The next development step is for the game's menu options to be read out loud to avoid assumptions about the children's reading skills. 
- The current word is highlighted to support children learning to read.
- While the proof of concept's narration and subtitles are in \[Standard American\] English, the game generation framework (Ren'Py) used offers [multi-language support](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/translation.html).


### Learning Goals

After engaging with the project, I want players to 
- Feel more familiar with the BCM, and
- Begin/continue to develop positive associations with the museum.

  
### Learning Theories

::TODO::

- Dual Coding Theory
