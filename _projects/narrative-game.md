### Concept Overview

<!-- "Brooklyn Kids" allows children to choose their own adventures when to explore the  -->

_This is the big picture of what you are trying to achieve with the project. 
(Ex: Young adults struggle with self-worth and mental health challenges. 
This project uses a game where emotions like coping, optimism and asking for help are a part of the learning)._



### Statement of Need

Statement of Need/Problem or Design Challenge

_What are you trying to solve?_



### Concept Description

_Tell me here about the overall project and why you chose the media for this project. 
Perhaps you tell a little about why you think this works for your audience._



### Target Audience

Children (approximately 4-8 years old) who have recently, or will so, 
visit the [Brooklyn Children's Museum](https://www.brooklynkids.org/) in [Brooklyn, New York](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rYMesQ8Xb2M3hkEx8). 
  

_Proof of concept v. long-term vision:_

- The next development step is for the game's menu options to be read out-loud to 
avoid assumptions about the children's reading skills. 
- While the PoC's narration and subtitles are in \[Standard American\] English, 
the game generation framework (Ren'Py) used offers [multi-language support](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/translation.html).
