## Concept Overview

A brief, interactive online lesson will be assigned as homework before the Narrative, Digital Media, and Learning class discussion I will lead about narrative and digital accessibility. The goal is to help build a common (introductory) understanding of what accessibility means and set the stage for the class discussion about digital accessibility.

## Target Audience

The students in this master's level NYU class are primarily first-year graduate students enrolled in various programs. Therefore, I do not want to assume that every student is already familiar with digital accessibility.


## Learning Goals

The goal of this brief lesson is for students to gain (or review) a basic understanding of the following:

- What is accessibility?
- Why does accessibility matter?
- A definition of "digital accessibility." 


## Prototype

I used the free trial of [Articulate 360](https://www.articulate.com/360/)'s Rise 360 [microlearning](https://community.articulate.com/articles/rise-360-create-new-microlearning) tool because its web interface made it easy to create and customize a lesson with interactive components quickly. In addition to short blocks of text, the lesson includes four "flippable" flashcards, one multiple-choice question, and a clickable labeled image. I included these interactive components to encourage users to participate actively in the lesson.

> ##### ⚠️&nbsp; ABOUT THE PROTOTYPE
>
> - It is a PDF rather than the live version to ensure continued access since I created the lesson using a free trial. _(Note: Since Articulate supports exporting the lesson as HTML, a production version could easily and should be self-hosted.)_
>  
> - It was created by exporting the course as a PDF using the built-in tool and then edited with Adobe Acrobat. While these steps resolved some formatting, readability, and other issues, the process likely introduced other cross-application and accessibility issues _(e.g., the heading hierarchy is somewhat unclear)_.
>  
> - Context that would not be on the live site is prefixed by "Note: " and is written in dark red Comic Sans.

## Next Steps

- Simplify the lesson's language.
- Have an ~expert review the lesson material.
- Improve lesson accessibility _(e.g., ensure consistent heading structure is clear visually and with a screen reader)_.
- Incorporate participants' feedback: Parts of the lesson that seem clear and complete to me (as the lesson creator) may not be to others.
  

## Acknowledgments

- This project was initially created for NYU's graduate course [Narrative, Digital Media and Learning](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/courses/narrative-digital-media-and-learning). After the course, I remade the prototype, incorporating some material from my graduate course [Digital Frictions - Museum Accessibility and Digital Design](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/museumstudies/courses/spring-2024-course-schedule.html).
- This project's cover image is from a Taylor & Francis [article](https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/publishing-your-research/writing-your-paper/importance-of-accessibility/).
- The microlearning includes content-specific source links.
