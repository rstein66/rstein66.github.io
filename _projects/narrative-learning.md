### Concept Overview

<!-- This is the big picture of what you are trying to achieve with the project. 
(Ex: Young adults struggle with self-worth and mental health challenges. 
This project uses a game where emotions like coping, optimism and asking for help are a part of the learning). -->



### Statement of Need

After finishing my undergraduate degree, I hiked from Maine to Georgia on the 2,200 mile 



### Target Audience

### Concept Description

I will create an [Articulate 360](https://www.articulate.com/360/) Rise 360 [microlearning](https://community.articulate.com/articles/rise-360-create-new-microlearning) project about my Appalachian Trail thru-hike. The software makes it easy to quickly create customized and engaging presentations multimedia. In addition the listicle  pictured the prototype below, I will include interactive elements. For example, I will use Articulate's flashcard feature to introduce common trail terms like sobo, which means to hike southbound (north to south).
