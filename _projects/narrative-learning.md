## Concept Overview

A brief, interactive online lesson will be assigned as homework before the Narrative, Digital Media, and Learning class discussion I will lead about narrative and digital accessibility. The goal is to help build a common (introductory) understanding of what accessibility means and set the stage for the class discussion about digital accessibility.

## Target Audience

The students in this master's level NYU class are primarily first-year graduate students enrolled in a variety of programs. Therefore, I do not want to assume that every student is already familiar with digital accessibility.


## Learning Goals

The goal of this brief lesson is for students to gain (or review) a basic understanding of the following:

- What is accessibility?
- Why does accessibility matter?
- A definition of "digital accessibility." 


## Prototype

I used the free trial of [Articulate 360](https://www.articulate.com/360/)'s Rise 360 [microlearning](https://community.articulate.com/articles/rise-360-create-new-microlearning) tool because its web interface made it easy to create and customize a lesson with interactive components quickly. In addition to short blocks of text, the lesson includes four "flippable" flashcards, one multiple-choice question, and a clickable labeled image. I included these interactive components to encourage users to participate actively in the lesson.

## Next Steps

- Simplify microlearning's language
- Have an accessibility review the microlearning's material
- - ðŸ“Œ consistent formatting

- ðŸ“Œself-host (screen recording isn't ideal. not screen reader friendly)

## Acknowledgments

- This project was initially created for NYU's graduate course [Narrative, Digital Media and Learning](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/courses/narrative-digital-media-and-learning). After the course, I remade the prototype, incorporating some material from my graduate course [Digital Frictions - Museum Accessibility and Digital Design](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/museumstudies/courses/spring-2024-course-schedule.html).
    
- This project's cover image is from a Taylor & Francis [article](https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/publishing-your-research/writing-your-paper/importance-of-accessibility/).

- The microlearning includes content-specific source links.
