## Reflection

Before this course, Narrative, Digital Media, and Learning, I had not thought much about narrative since college. As an art history
minor, those narratives were almost exclusively pictorial. Narrative was not discussed much in my other minor (educational studies), and it was not discussed at all in my major (computer science). 

After graduation, I worked as a software developer and consultant. I thought about consistent branding, messaging, and user-friendly workflows. But I would not have thought to use the word "narrative." The closest we came was discussing _[user stories](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories)_. I suspect this was true for several reasons. I primarily worked on the backend. When I worked on customer-facing features, I almost always had a vision created by the talented designers and copywriters I worked with to follow. I did not work on games or other projects that we typically associate with words like “narrative.” Finally, in my experience, it is simply not part of the lexicon of either software development or computer science. 

And now that I am back in school and taking this course? I am excited to learn about learning theory/science and its applications!
