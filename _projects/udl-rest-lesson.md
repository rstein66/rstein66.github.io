### Overview

‚ÄúHow Do You Rest?‚Äù is a Universal Design for Learning (UDL) guided sixth-grade lesson plan. The plan outlines an accessible lesson about ‚ÄúRest Is Power.‚Äù Curated by the Center for Black Visual Culture at New York University, the fall 2023 art exhibition focused on how Black people‚Äôs ‚Äúrest is resistance.‚Äù My lesson plan covers the pre-trip, onsite, and post-trip.

My plan‚Äôs primary outcomes/objectives are that students will:

- Practice observation, using descriptive language, and building visual literacy.  
- Think about the importance of rest and identify at least one form in their lives.  
- Recognize that rest is an act of resistance for Black people.

### Lesson Plan ‚Äì How Do You Rest?

<div class="footnote"><a name="exhibition-footnote"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The exhibition was curated by the Center for Black Visual Culture at New York University. It focused on how Black people‚Äôs ‚Äúrest is resistance.‚Äù It ran from September to October 2023. In this imagined lesson plan, the exhibition is current.</div>
  
  
#### Materials

<div class="back-to-top"><a href="#" class="top">BACK TO TOP <i class="fas fa-angle-up"></i></a></div>

<u>Note</u>: Add student-specific assistive technology where appropriate. <i>_For example, a student whose IEP states they can use a computer to type instead of writing something out by hand._  

**Pre-Visit Materials**
  
- LCD projector and teacher laptop  
- Fruit for the activity (lemons or similar)  
- Printouts  
    + Site-specific social narrative<sup> [\[2\]](#accessible-footnote)</sup>    
    + "How Rest Is An Act Of Resistance For Black People" (Wilson, 2023)  

**Visit Materials**
  
- Printed Handouts  
    +  UDL Rest Worksheet
    +  Site-specific sensory guide<sup> [\[2\]](#accessible-footnote)</sup>    
- Clipboards  
- Writing implements  
  
**Post-Visit Materials**

- Student laptops  
- Visual component of assessment, if applicable.
  
<div class="footnote"><a name="accessible-footnote"><sup>[2]</sup></a>  A <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/sensory_resources_guide_for_museums/social-narrative/#:~:text=Google%20Slides%20version" target="_blank">social narrative</a> and <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/sensory_resources_guide_for_museums/sensory-guide/#:~:text=Sensory%20Guide%20Template%20(GoogleSlide)" target="_blank">sensory guide</a> for this one small room (especially one with little of sensory note), likely adds little value, but I want to introduce the concepts and so included templates from the ‚ÄúSensory Resources Guide For Museum‚Äù by NYU‚Äôs Ability Project.</div>
  
  

  
#### Prior Learning Connections
  
<div class="back-to-top"><a href="#" class="top">BACK TO TOP <i class="fas fa-angle-up"></i></a></div>
  
- [‚ÄúWhere I‚Äôm From‚Äù](http://www.georgeellalyon.com/where.html) poems ‚Äì due to this assignment, students will already be familiar with using descriptive language, discussing personal topics like family, and sharing respectful feedback on other students' work.  


  

#### Differentiation and Accommodations

<div class="back-to-top"><a href="#" class="top">BACK TO TOP <i class="fas fa-angle-up"></i></a></div>

This lesson plan is intended to be reasonably widely accessible; however, it assumes that specific accommodations will be made on a case-by-case basis.  

<!-- FIXME The remainder of this section addresses  -->

<!-- FIXME Not all accommodations are listed below. Many students will follow their d/Deaf or hard of heading students -->


**English Writing Skills**

- The Assessment intentionally allows a wide range of English writing skill levels. For example, it is not prescriptive about vocabulary or even minimum length. Students can choose their format (e.g., paragraphs, drawings, etc.) for the second of the two parts.  

- Students will spend most of their time at the gallery working independently. If they finish the activity quickly, then they can select another artwork.  

- As currently written, this lesson plan does not make specific accommodations for students with emerging English multilingualism. The assignment could be written in any language, but the class discussion and sharing activities would likely need person-specific accommodations for students early in their English language acquisition. 


**Written Word**

- The site visit worksheet includes the teacher‚Äôs example for students who want to refer back to it. While this helps anyone who wants it, it especially aids students with extra needs, such as those with limited hearing or shorter-term memory loss.    
  

**Students With Blindness or Low Vision**<sup> [\[3\]](#limited-vision-footnote)</sup>

- Depending on the student‚Äôs level of sight and comfort, it might make sense to go through the exhibition catalog beforehand with the student to select an artwork whose description resonates with them. During the gallery visit, that student and a sighted student could work together. If this occurs, and the two students are willing, they should share their descriptions and experiences crafting it with the class!  


**Students With Limited Mobility**

- If the student‚Äôs level of mobility makes it difficult for them to study an artwork in its current configuration, the artist and gallery might allow the student to use a high-quality printout of the work‚Äôs photo during the lesson.  

- The gallery appears to be wheelchair accessible.


**Neurodivergent Students**

- ["Combating Sensory Overload: How Zoos and Museums Are Redefining Inclusion" (Cleaver, 2022)](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/22/travel/sensory-disabilities-travel.html?mwgrp=c-dbar&unlocked_article_code=1.H00.Zr3u.vZ6giCsrWWec&hpgrp=ar-abar&smid=url-share)  

- If applicable, request the gallery's permission before bringing Magic Model clay or similar fidget tools.


<div class="footnote"><a name="limited-sight-footnote"><sup>[3]</sup></a>  While not applicable for this visit, <a href="https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/designing-for-touch-975e47065935" target="blank">swell printing</a> seems like an intriguing way to potentially interact with two-dimensional art, especially as three-dimensional printing continues to be more widely accessible. The <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/event/event_series/minds-eye" target="blank">Guggenheim Museum‚Äôs Mind‚Äôs Eye Programs</a> have previously used it.</div> 


  

#### Special Concerns

<div class="back-to-top"><a href="#" class="top">BACK TO TOP <i class="fas fa-angle-up"></i></a></div>

_(Classroom management items, medication information, etc.)_

- <u>Allergies</u>: Do not use food students are allergic to in the ‚Äúlemon identification activity.‚Äù 

  

#### Assessment

<div class="back-to-top"><a href="#" class="top">BACK TO TOP <i class="fas fa-angle-up"></i></a></div>


**Formative Assessment** 

The teacher will monitor, without grading, student learning throughout their participation (both verbal and non-verbal). During the independent work time at the gallery, the teacher will circulate. 

**Summative Assessment**
