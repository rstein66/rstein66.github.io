### Overview

“How Do You Rest?” is a Universal Design for Learning (UDL) guided sixth-grade lesson plan. The plan outlines an accessible lesson about “Rest Is Power.” Curated by the Center for Black Visual Culture at NYU, the fall 2023 art exhibition focused on how Black people’s “rest is resistance.” My lesson plan covers the pre-trip, onsite, and post-trip.

My plan’s primary outcomes/objectives are that students will:

- Practice observation, using descriptive language, and building visual literacy.  
- Think about the importance of rest and identify at least one form in their lives.  
- Recognize that rest is an act of resistance for Black people.
